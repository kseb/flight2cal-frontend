# Flight2calFrontend

Frontend for [Flight2calBackend](https://github.com/kseb/flight2cal-backend).

It's a simple Angular application. You can choose an departure and arrival airport,
a date and get a list of all flights on that day. With a click on a specific flight
you get a [ics file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) for download including all necessary information of the flight which
you can import in a calendar of your choice. It supports auto completion for the
airports when there are at least three letters in the text field.
